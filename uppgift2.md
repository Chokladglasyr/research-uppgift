## Multiple user mess!

So at start i signed up with two differnet emails, one personal and one for school, but got recommended to not use school email. 
At the end of school I thought I could just save the projects I wanted to keep, but then again fun to see it all from start too. 
So I switched, but that caused me some problems, I had to relogg in Git Bash and yet it still didn't want to work for me. After lots of 
googling I managed to find out I had to change [credential username](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47465644/github-remote-permission-denied
) too. Said and done!
