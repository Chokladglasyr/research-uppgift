Of course I thought the first .txt files were what we were going to work with...  
But now I realized the .md and .txt is NOT the same!  
So here I am, on a new branch, with .md files!   
Several, just for the fun of it, for experimenting.  


### [Startup mess!](/startup-mess.md)
> About the awkward mess I made at start.

### [Multiple user mess!](/uppgift2.md)
> About how what happened when I tried to switch users.

### [Commands I've learnt](/learnt-commandos.md)
> A list of some of the commands I've used so far.

In main branchen you can find the following files:

+ newFile.txt
+ terminal-Kommandon.txt
+ uppgift.md

These are the first files I worked with, I then continued in this branch instead.
