## Startup mess!

So last week when the videos from Olli got released I started with GitHub immediately. 
I had troubles from the start, it didn't really look anything like Ollis screen and 
the commands were off, like ```ls -a``` didn't work for me. I had to write ``` ls -Hidden ```
So ofc I messaged Olli with all my problems, but I continued at it, with lots of googling 
I managed to fix my problems but not knowing exactly what I did. So I messaged him about that too...
**Heehee* *
Later that same weekend I had another go at it all, and thats when I realized it. I watched the wrong
video first. So what I did to * *fix* * it was displayed in the first video, with explanation...

***Awkward!***
